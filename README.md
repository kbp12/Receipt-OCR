# Receipt: Optical Character Recognition 
##### This project uses OpenCV for Image Segmentation and Tesseract for Text Recognition.

Business Use Case -Invoices and Receipts are an essential aspect of any trade between two parties,
be it between companies or between roadside stores and a consumer. Manually reconciling digital
invoices is very time-consuming and can also cause manual human errors.

Extracting information from any document is an uphill task and involves a combination
of object classification and object localisation.

OCR digitisation addresses the challenge of automatically extracting, which plays a critical
role in streamlining document-intensive processes and office automation in many financial,
accounting, and taxation areas.
